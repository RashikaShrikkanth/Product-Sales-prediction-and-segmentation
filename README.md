# Product-Sales-prediction-and-segmentation
This is my first project on the real time data
Loaded the dataset in Python. Understood the dataset. Checked for duplicate rows and columns. Checked and treated the Outliers and Null values. Plotted graphs and drawn insights. Done Feature Engineering and Segmentation. Encoded the categorical variables and scaled the data. Separated the train and test set for model building. Built the base model as linear regression and advance model as Gradient Boosting Regressor.
